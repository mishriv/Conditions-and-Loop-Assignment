Ques: What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples. 
Solution: 
Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. There are several types of conditional statements in JavaScript, including the if statement, the if...else statement, and the switch statement.

1. if statement:
if (condition) {
    // Block of code to execute if the condition is true
}

let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}


2. if...else statement: 

let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}

3. else if statement:

let x = 10;
if (x > 15) {
    console.log("x is greater than 15");
} else if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15");
} else {
    console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}

4. switch statement:
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes the associated block of code. It provides an alternative way to handle multiple conditions. Here's the syntax:

let day = "Monday";
switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("It's Monday!");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("It's Tuesday!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's neither Monday nor Tuesday.");
}
