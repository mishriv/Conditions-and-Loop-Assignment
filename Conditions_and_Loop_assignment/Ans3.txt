Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Answer

Loops are programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. Loops help in reducing redundancy and making code more concise and efficient.

1. For loop:

syntex:
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // Block of code to be executed
}

example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration", i);
}
//This loop will execute the block of code inside the curly braces 5 times, with the loop variable i starting from 0, incrementing by 1 on each iteration, and stopping when i becomes equal to 5.

2. while loop

syntex
while (condition) {
    // Block of code to be executed
}

Example:
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Iteration", i);
    i++;
}
//This loop will execute the block of code inside the curly braces as long as the condition i < 5 is true. The loop variable i is initialized outside the loop and incremented within the loop.

3. do...while loop:

Syntax:
javascript
do {
    // Block of code to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Iteration", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
//This loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will execute at least once before checking the condition. The loop will continue executing as long as the condition i < 5 is true.
